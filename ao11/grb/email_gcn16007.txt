Re: GRB 140320C

Dear colleagues,

INTEGRAL detected GRB 140320C (GCN 16007) during an observation of proposal 1170002 - SN 2014J (M82) - in revolution 1396.

The GRB occurred on 2014-03-20 at 13:17:20 UT, at the position of RA, Dec (J2000.0) = 134.4175, +71.2002 deg, which was 5.9 degrees off-axis (from pointing ID 13960017 with RA, Dec of 148.972, 75.324 deg).

A preliminary analysis gives a peak flux of about 0.15 counts counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1 s integration time) as reported by IBAS.

The TAC recommendations regarding GRB data rights applicable to the accepted AO-10 proposals: 1140003 (Hurley), 1140004 (Hanlon), 1140025 (Gotz), imply for this GRB that:

1140004 (Hanlon) will be granted data rights on all instruments.

The GRB data on which rights are granted cover at most the time period starting 1 hour before the burst and ending 24 hours after the burst. Please note that data you receive cover the entire FOV around and including the targets of interest in the observation.

We are looking forward to a successful analysis of the data.

Best regards,
Guillaume Belanger
