Re: GRB 140710B

Dear colleagues,

INTEGRAL detected GRB 140710B (GCN 16576) during an observation of proposal 1140029 - PSR B1259-63 - in revolution 1433.

The GRB occurred on 2014-07-10 at 21:37:30 UT, at the position of RA, Dec (J2000.0) = 204.657, -58.5854 deg, which was 8.9 degrees off-axis (from pointing ID 14330084 with RA, Dec of 198.845, -67.130 deg).

A preliminary analysis gives a peak flux of about 1.2 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1 s integration time) as reported by IBAS.

The TAC recommendations regarding GRB data rights applicable to the accepted AO-10 proposals: 1140003 (Hurley), 1140004 (Hanlon), 1140025 (Gotz), imply for this GRB that:

1140004 (Hanlon) will be granted data rights on all instruments.

The GRB data on which rights are granted cover at most the time period starting 1 hour before the burst and ending 24 hours after the burst. Please note that data you receive cover the entire FOV around and including the targets of interest in the observation.

We are looking forward to a successful analysis of the data.

Best regards,
Guillaume Belanger
