Re: GRB 141004A

Dear colleagues,

INTEGRAL detected GRB 141004A (GCN 16879) during an observation of proposal 8860299 - Crab Cal 2014 - in revolution 1462.

The GRB occurred on 2014-10-04 at 23:21:02 UT, at the position of RA, Dec (J2000.0) = 76.7496, +12.8235 deg, which was 13.2 degrees off-axis (from pointing ID 14620056 with RA, Dec of 89.104, 18.446 deg).

A preliminary analysis gives a peak flux of about 4 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1 s integration time) as reported by IBAS.

The TAC recommendations regarding GRB data rights applicable to the accepted AO-10 proposals: 1140003 (Hurley), 1140004 (Hanlon), 1140025 (Gotz), imply for this GRB that:

1140004 (Hanlon) will be granted data rights on all instruments.

The GRB data on which rights are granted cover at most the time period starting 1 hour before the burst and ending 24 hours after the burst. Please note that data you receive cover the entire FOV around and including the targets of interest in the observation.

We are looking forward to a successful analysis of the data.

Best regards,
Guillaume Belanger
