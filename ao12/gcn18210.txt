S.Mereghetti (IASF-Milano), D.Gotz (CEA, Saclay), C.Ferrigno, E.Bozzo,
L.Ducci (ISDC, Versoix), and J.Borkowski (CAMK, Torun) on behalf of the
IBAS Localization Team report:

GRB 150831A (Lien et al. GCN 18209) lasting 2 s has been detected by IBAS in the
IBIS/ISGRI data with a significance slightly below the threshold for
automatic alert delivery (IBAS Weak Alert n.7228 was distributed at
10:34:24 UT on August 31 2015.

The IBIS/ISGRI refined coordinates (J2000) are:

R.A.= 221.0207 deg
DEC.= -25.6474 deg

with an uncertainty of 3   arcmin (90% c.l.).

The burst had a peak flux of about 1.7 counts/cm2/s (20-200 keV, 1-s integration time) and a fluence in the same energy range of about 3x10e-7 erg/cm2.

A plot of the light curve will  be posted at
